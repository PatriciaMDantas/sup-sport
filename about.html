    <h1>SUP - Stand Up Paddle</h1>

    <div class="text">
      Standup paddleboarding (SUP), the act of propelling oneself on a floating
      platform with the help of a paddle or pole, traces back thousands of years
      and across many continents, but its current form and popularity originated
      in Hawaii in the 1900s. Records of earlier forms of SUP have been found as
      early as 3,000 B.C. and its iterations span over various regions such as
      Peru, Levant, Italy, and China.

      Modern standup paddleboarding began in the 1940s in Waikiki. John Ah Choy
      was a local Hawaiian who surfed, but as he got older and was unable to get
      up and down from his board, he would stand on his board from the break and
      paddle out with a canoe paddle to catch waves. His sons, Leroy and Bobby
      Ah Choy, and their friend, Duke Kahanamoku, started to mimic this while
      they taught surfing to visiting tourists. They did this as a way to keep
      an eye on surf students while also monitoring the incoming swell. They
      also utilized the vantage point of being out on the water to take
      pictures.

      As the style became popular with other surfers, it took on the name Beach
      Boy Surfing after the instructors, who were called Waikiki Beach Boys.
      Steve West credits outrigger canoeing combined with surfing as the basis
      of SUP, since the individual skills (board riding and paddling) already
      existed. In the 1990s Laird Hamilton redefined and modernized standup
      paddleboarding as a sport. In 2004, SUP surfing was added as a category in
      the Buffalo Big Board Contest.

      Standup paddleboarding has diversified from a variation of surfing into
      racing, touring, yoga, whitewater, and fishing. Its surfing heritage
      coupled with its various disciplines make the sport attractive and
      accessible to everyone, regardless of ability.

      The first magazine devoted to the sport, Standup Journal, was founded in
      June 2007.
